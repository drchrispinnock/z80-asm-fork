This is the Z80 Assembler from 
	http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/z80-asm.html

I've forked it here to get it to build on Mac OS X Big Sur
with GCC. I cannot get it to compile with Xcode clang at the
moment.

Changes:
* One of the cpu pins had to be renamed to avoid a conflict
* An error function needed to be added to lcd_display
